A simple mobile todo list app on top of caldav, written in flutter.

While I use it with Kolab (kolab.org), it *should* in principle work with any caldav server.

Initial focus and features:
* Android app (I don't have an ios device)
* Shopping list (I use a shared todolist as shopping list, and that's where the tile layout works best I suppose)
* View/Complete/Add todos on the go with ease
* View tasks that are currently in "doing" (maps to IN-PROCESS ical property)
* Multi-account support
